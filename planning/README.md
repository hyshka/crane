# Anatomies

## What are they?
Anatomies are the basic pieces of the key pages on a website. Like a butcher diagram they give a very high level view of what priority each piece has and begins to suggest positioning in the flow of the page.

## What to do
Based on strategy work, key pages are listed out (from sitemap). Then all the pieces of each page are layed out according to priority and purpose of content and arranged in blocks on a page. The items will typically be identified by the strategy work but design may be involved to help understand what those are. 

## Deliverable
Key pages to be created in sketch and shared with client using Invision. A meeting is likely not necessary.

**TIME ESTIMATE 1-3 HOURS - (Not required for every project)**
